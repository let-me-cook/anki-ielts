        <p>The two charts below illustrate the changes in proportion of the average household expenditures over 6
            decades from 1950 to 2010.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5 id="feedback">Feedback</h5>
    <p>-<strong>Task Response/Task Achievement:</strong> The introduction is adequate in stating the purpose of the
        charts. However, it lacks a brief overview of the main trends. It should mention the overall shifts in spending
        patterns across the categories. For example, it could mention that spending on housing decreased while spending
        on food increased.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Coherence &amp; Cohesion:</strong> The introduction is clear and concise, setting the context
        appropriately. However, adding a brief overview would improve the coherence with the following paragraphs.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Grammatical Range &amp; Accuracy:</strong> The grammar is correct.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Lexical Resource:</strong> The vocabulary is appropriate but could be more precise. Instead of
        "proportion of the average household expenditures," consider using "average household expenditure distribution"
        or a similar phrase.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The two charts illustrate the changes in the distribution of average household expenditures across major
            categories from 1950 to 2010. The data reveals a significant shift in spending patterns, with a notable
            decrease in expenditure on housing and a corresponding increase in spending on food, while other categories
            remained relatively stable.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The most significant changes can be seen where the average household spends significantly less on housing and
            more on food over the decades. Meanwhile, the amount of money spent on transportation had also slightly
            increased. Whereas the proportions of spending on other categories had stayed relatively the same over the
            course of the decades.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5 id="feedback">Feedback</h5>
    <p>-<strong>Task Response/Task Achievement:</strong> This paragraph attempts an overview but is too detailed. An
        overview should summarize the main trends, not delve into specific figures. It should highlight the key changes
        across all categories, not just focus on housing, food, and transportation.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Coherence &amp; Cohesion:</strong> The overview lacks smooth transitions. The use of "Meanwhile" and
        "Whereas" is somewhat abrupt.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Grammatical Range &amp; Accuracy:</strong> The grammar is mostly correct, but the sentence structure is
        repetitive.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Lexical Resource:</strong> The vocabulary is simple and lacks precision.</p>
    <h5 id="rewrite-suggestion">Rewrite suggestion</h5>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Overall, the charts show a dramatic decrease in the proportion of household expenditure allocated to housing
            and a substantial increase in spending on food between 1950 and 2010. Expenditure on transportation also
            rose moderately, while spending on other categories remained relatively constant.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4 id="body-paragraph-1">Body Paragraph 1</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Looking at the details of the charts, the expenditures of the average families on housing had decreased by
            one third of it's original portion of 72 percent. While food portion of the spending had increased by one
            third of its original portion of 11 percent, a slight increase of spending by 10 percent on transportation
            can also be seen by the families over the years.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5 id="feedback">Feedback</h5>
    <p>-<strong>Task Response/Task Achievement:</strong> This paragraph provides some detail but lacks clarity and
        precision. The phrasing is awkward, and the comparisons are not clearly structured. The use of percentages is
        unclear â€“ are these percentage point changes or percentage changes relative to the total expenditure?</p>
    <p>-<strong>Coherence &amp; Cohesion:</strong> The paragraph is poorly structured. The transitions between the
        different categories are not smooth.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Grammatical Range &amp; Accuracy:</strong> There are grammatical errors ("it's" should be "its"). The
        sentence structure is clumsy.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Lexical Resource:</strong> The vocabulary is repetitive and imprecise. The phrase "portion of the
        spending" is awkward.</p>
    <h5 id="rewrite-suggestion">Rewrite suggestion</h5>
    <blockquote>
        <p> A detailed analysis reveals that housing expenditure decreased by approximately one-third from its initial
            72% share, while the proportion allocated to food increased by one-third from its original 11%.
            Transportation costs also saw a modest 10% increase over the period.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4 id="body-paragraph-2">Body Paragraph 2</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p>While the housing, food and portion had undergone changes, the chart shows that the other categories like
            health care, education has stayed relatively unchanged.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5 id="feedback">Feedback</h5>
    <p>-<strong>Task Response/Task Achievement:</strong> This paragraph is too brief and lacks supporting data. It
        should specify which other categories remained unchanged and ideally provide some numerical information to
        support the claim.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Coherence &amp; Cohesion:</strong> The transition from the previous paragraph is weak. The use of
        "While" is not very effective.</p>
    <p>-<strong>Grammatical Range &amp; Accuracy:</strong> There is a subject-verb agreement error ("has stayed" should
        be "have stayed").</p>
    <p>-<strong>Lexical Resource:</strong> The vocabulary is limited.</p>
    <h5 id="rewrite-suggestion">Rewrite suggestion</h5>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In contrast to the significant changes in housing and food expenditures, the remaining categories, including
            healthcare and education, showed relatively little change in their share of total household spending
            throughout the period. Further detailed analysis would be required to confirm the exact percentage changes
            in these areas.</p>

        <li><strong>Clear Overview:</strong> Begin with a concise overview summarizing the main trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Data-Driven Analysis:</strong> Support your descriptions with specific data points from the charts.

            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Briefly introduce the charts and state their purpose. Example: "The
                provided charts illustrate the shift in average household spending patterns across several key
                categories between 1950 and 2010."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Summarize the main trends. Example: "Overall, the data reveals a significant
                decrease in the proportion of household income spent on housing, a substantial increase in food
                expenditure, and relatively minor changes in other categories."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 1:</strong> Focus on the most significant changes. Example: "The most dramatic
                shift is observed in housing expenditure, which declined from [original percentage]% in 1950 to [final
                percentage]% in 2010, representing a decrease of approximately [percentage]% points. Conversely,
                spending on food increased significantly from [original percentage]% to [final percentage]%,
                representing a rise of approximately [percentage]% points."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Body Paragraph 2:</strong> Discuss the less significant changes or remaining categories. Example:
                "In contrast to the substantial changes in housing and food, expenditure on transportation experienced a
                more modest increase, rising from [original percentage]% to [final percentage]%. Other categories, such
                as healthcare and education, showed relatively little change over the six decades."</p>
